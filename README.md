Atom is a web page created as a project of the university I attend. Its purpose is to use AI to perform simulations with the concept of induction furnaces, which is a heating principle discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 while experimenting in his laboratory.

Atom combines the visually minimalist with artificial integration to perform electromagnetic heating simulations.
